I’ve been an engineer my whole life. As early as I can remember I’ve been taking things apart and trying to learn how everything works. When I was young, I was taking apart RC cars, now I enjoy working on the full sized ones - I love cars, motorcycles, and everything in between. I’m also obsessed with machines, from 3D printers to lathes to wire EDM machines.

I have two years of experience in Mechanical Engineering roles, most of which have been fast-paced prototyping environments. I’m a quick learner, and my motto is that there’s always a way to get the job done. I’ve worked at Greensight, Orbis, Instron, and Draper. 

I’m looking for full time work, especially in automotive, automation, aerospace, machining, motorsports, and additive manufacturing fields. I’m open to work anywhere that has interesting problems to solve, as long as they’re not defense related!



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
