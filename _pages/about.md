I’ve been an engineer my whole life. As early as I can remember I’ve been taking things apart and trying to learn how everything works. When I was young, I was taking apart RC cars, now I enjoy working on the full sized ones - I love cars, motorcycles, and everything in between. I’m also obsessed with machines, from 3D printers to lathes to wire EDM machines.

I have two years of experience in Mechanical Engineering roles, most of which have been fast-paced prototyping environments. I’m a quick learner, and my motto is that there’s always a way (and I'll find it). I’ve worked at <a href='#'>Greensight</a>, <a href='#'>Orbis</a>, <a href='#'>Instron</a>, and <a href='#'>Draper</a>. 

I’m looking for full time work, especially in automotive, automation, aerospace, machining, motorsports, and additive manufacturing fields. I’m open to work anywhere that has interesting problems to solve, as long as they’re not defense related.
