Dear Hiring Manager,

Over the years my **passion for engines** has grown in scope from loving the naturally aspirated 4 cylinder engine of <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/projects/cars'>my Mazda Miata</a>, to being obsessed with the complex **turbocharger/generator MGU-H units** that help Formula 1 engines achieve insane thermal efficiencies, to marveling at the elegance of the **gas generator engine cycle** used in the F-1 engines on the Saturn V (see my <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/projects/saturnv-2l'>Saturn V-2L</a>). As I took my favorite courses at Northeastern University - **thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics** - my love for engines only grew.
I’ve also enjoyed tinkering with 3D printers for awhile now, so when I had a conversation with **Dylan Mouri** about Relativity Space, I realized this is where my interests perfectly align. 
>With my experience **leading projects in fast-paced startups**,
>experience in **metal additive manufacturing**,
>strong foundation in **engineering fundamentals**,
>and a passion for **thermodynamics, engines, and space exploration**,
>I’m confident I would be a great fit for the **Combustion Devices - Propulsion Design Engineer I** position at Relativity.

In my co-op experiences at fast-paced startups, **I took ownership of the mechanical side of projects while collaborating across teams.** Most recently, I led the mechanical design of <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/projects/greensight/'>WeatherHive</a>, an autonomous drone silo system capable of storing, charging, launching, and loading 10 weather drones. This project sharpened my ability to **develop and test highly integrated systems**, perform **simulation-driven design validation**, and **coordinate with other engineering teams** to allow for parallel development and seamless integration. Whether optimizing heat dissipation of electrical components or designing fatigue-resistant components, I gained **practical experience applying thermodynamic and mechanical principles to real-world engineering challenges.**

Beyond industry experience, my academic background has given me a solid understanding of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. I not only excelled in these subjects at Northeastern University, consistently achieving top scores, but also reinforced my expertise through **teaching and mentorship**. Soon I will serve as a **TA for a fluid mechanics study abroad program in Panama**, further solidifying my ability to communicate complex engineering concepts. My engineering capstone also gave me **experience working with metal additive manufacturing** - <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/projects/capstone/'>we built a Wire EDM machine</a> that we designed to cut large-format metal 3D printed parts off of build plates.

I am excited by the opportunity to **contribute to Relativity’s development of Terran R and push the boundaries of additive manufacturing**. Please feel free to explore <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/'>my website</a> or contact me at **nathankadria@gmail.com / (774) 303-0696**. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my passions, skills, and experience align with Relativity’s mission.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,

Nathan Kadria
