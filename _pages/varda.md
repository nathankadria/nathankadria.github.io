Dear Hiring Manager,

I am passionate about spacecraft, rocketry, and everything aerospace. When I came across Varda, I was excited to see a company tackling the unique challenge of **reentry**—a crucial but often overlooked aspect of space infrastructure. Varda’s work intersects with **thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics**, subjects I am deeply passionate about. It’s impressive to see a company successfully deploy such an integrated system as W-1 and achieve reentry on the first attempt after just three years of development. With my **experience leading mechanical projects in fast-paced startups, a strong foundation in engineering fundamentals, and a passion for space exploration**, I am eager to contribute as a **Mechanical Engineer at Varda**, particularly in propulsion and other thermofluid applications.

In my **co-op experiences at fast-paced startups**, I took ownership of the mechanical side of projects while collaborating across teams. Most recently, I led the mechanical design of <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com/projects/greensight/'>WeatherHive</a>, an autonomous drone silo system capable of storing, charging, launching, and loading 10 weather drones. This project sharpened my ability to **develop and test highly integrated systems**, perform **simulation-driven design validation**, and coordinate with electrical and software teams to allow for parallel development. Whether optimizing heat dissipation of electrical components or designing fatigue-resistant components, I gained **practical experience applying thermodynamic and mechanical principles to real-world engineering challenges**.

Beyond industry experience, my academic background has strengthened my understanding of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. I not only excelled in these subjects at **Northeastern University**, consistently achieving top scores, but also reinforced my expertise through **teaching and mentorship**. This summer, I will serve as a **TA for a fluid mechanics study abroad program in Panama**, further solidifying my ability to communicate complex engineering concepts.

I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to Varda’s engineering team and help push the boundaries of in-space manufacturing. Please feel free to explore my work at <a href='https://www.nathankadria.com'>www.nathankadria.com </a> or contact me at **nathankadria@gmail.com / (774) 303-0696**. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills align with Varda’s mission.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,

Nathan Kadria
