As a mechanical engineer that loves cars and has an underdeveloped pre-frontal cortex, it was only a matter of time before I got a motorcycle (or a few of them). Motorcycles are great for me because they're everything I love about cars, just better and more attainable. They're cheaper, much faster, sound better (for the same $), and are even more fun to throw around corners. I keep both of my bikes in Boston during the riding season, and I'm convinced it is the fastest way to get around the city, period.My favorite kind of bikes are sportbikes, mostly because they essentially come with race engines from the factory. I took my 600 to the track last year, and I'm hooked. As soon as I have some funds and the weather gets better, I'll be at the track. 

## 2003 Honda CBR600RR
AKA Zuko

BUY: 2900

I bought this bike when I got back from California, as I thought it was about time I moved up from the 250 and I wanted a bike I could take to the track. The 250 would've been great for the track, but it had 16" wheels which have extremely limited tire selection. I could've done some mods to adapt the later gen Ninja 250 17" wheels to the bike, but I could also just buy another bike, so that's what I did! The bike came into my posession in fair condition for its age. The speedo didn't work, and it had clearly been dropped by a previous owner. I just replaced the speed sensor (kind of hard to get to) and got to riding. Suddenly, I had 120hp between my legs instead of 25hp, and it took some getting used to. It's been 3 seasons and I haven't died yet!

I took Zuko to Palmer Motorsports Part last year for my first track day, and had a blast. I rode my bike to the track and my mom brought the support minivan (RIP Baby). She also took tons of pictures, thanks mom! I definitely pushed myself too hard that day, and I got lucky a few times (dragged knee though).  Thankfully, I didn't crash out. Next time I'll take it easy, but hey, I was excited. A few track veterans took me under their wing and gave me lots of valuable advice (and lunch!). I learned about body positioning, where to put my weight on the bike, and a lot about the track. I'm super excited to come back to Palmer.

Right now, Zuko is in my friend Philip's basement for the winter. I'm doing some much needed maintenance in the off season, as it was running quite rough at the end of the season. The bike wouldn't maintain idle when it got past its warm-up period, and would die and not start unless I kept the throttle cracked open. It was also spitting a ton of fuel out of the exhaust and had extremely poor MPG (even worse than normal). It was fine at higher RPM, but something was definitely wrong. I replaced the spark plugs, no dice. Before the track day, I put some fuel injector cleaner in the tank, and it ran even worse. Once that tank was done, I filled it up with a new tank, and it ran like new! A few days after the track day, the problem came back. I think a primary injector (post throttle body) got clogged, which is causing misfires and making the secondary injectors work to make up for the non functioning primary. I recently checked the valve clearances, and those are all just barely in spec, so that shouldn't be the problem. I'm replacing the injectors, so we'll see how that goes.

#### Maintenance and Mods
- Front rotors and pads
- Tires (Rosso IV)
- Removed mirrors (I don't recommend this, it's for track and city use)
- Valve clearance check
- Injectors
- Spark plugs
- Speed sensor
- Chain and sprocket (-1 +3)
- Rebuilt forks
- Rebuilt forks again cause I messed it up. I might even have to do it again cause I keep treating speed bumps like jumps
- New kill switch & starter switch assembly
- Oil & filter
- Safety wire on oil filter, oil fill cap

## 1986 Kawasaki Concours 1000
AKA Toph

BUY: 1200

I bought this kind of on a whim. Old sport touring bikes are so cheap, and I just couldn't pass this one up. It has less than 20k and was in great condition. I've taken it up north to ride a few times, but wasn't able to as much as I wanted last semester. The seating position on this bike is much more comfortable, especially for a passenger. It also happens to weigh 300lbs more than my 600, but it's not too unwieldy. I think I'll end up selling this one soon. I think I only like riding it because it's a motorcycle, not because it's anything special. I have my eyes on the Honda VFR800 as a replacement, which is much more sporty but can still eat up the miles.
