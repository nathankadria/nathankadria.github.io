## Sunflyer

I worked with three other high school interns and was overseen by two Draper engineers on project Sunflyer, a remote-controlled model glider that was powered by solar cells. This project took place over 6 weeks and included design, acquiring materials, construction, testing, and presenting the final product to a room of senior engineers.
