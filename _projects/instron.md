My first co-op was at Instron's automation department. I focused on developing mockup systems for customer quotes, designing custom solutions to add to existing systems, and managing dozens of customer orders. I learned about communicating effectively between teams, making meaningful drawings, and interacting with customers.

## Automation System Mockup

- Mockup of small automation system for customer quote
- Existing Instron & COTS parts used wherever possible
- 100 vial capacity while staying within small form factor
- Removable vial racks
- Pneumatic actuators used to reduce control complexity
- Vision system included to detect failures
- System functionality animated to demonstrate to customer
